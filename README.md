# GraphQL Server in Rust ü¶Ä

A comprehensive GraphQL server implementation in Rust, built from scratch to understand the core concepts and architecture of GraphQL. This project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and implements all major GraphQL features step by step.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project aims to provide a deep understanding of:

- GraphQL specification and core concepts
- Server-side GraphQL implementation
- Rust programming for web services
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Test-driven development

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project is structured using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:

```text
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Core business logic and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/     # Use cases and application services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/  # External concerns (HTTP, persistence)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/    # API layer and request handling
```

## üìã Major GraphQL Features

### Core Features

- [x] **Schema Definition Language (SDL)** - Define GraphQL schemas
- [x] **Type System** - Scalars, Objects, Interfaces, Unions, Enums
- [x] **Query Execution** - Field resolution and data fetching
- [x] **Mutation Support** - Data modifications
- [x] **Subscription Support** - Real-time updates
- [x] **Introspection** - Schema exploration at runtime

### Advanced Features

- [x] **Validation** - Query validation against schema
- [x] **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error reporting
- [x] **DataLoader Pattern** - Efficient data loading and N+1 prevention
- [x] **Middleware/Directives** - Cross-cutting concerns
- [x] **Custom Scalars** - Extended type system
- [x] **Field Arguments** - Parameterized field resolution

### Performance & Production Features

- [x] **Query Complexity Analysis** - Prevent expensive queries
- [x] **Rate Limiting** - Request throttling
- [x] **Caching** - Response and field-level caching
- [x] **Metrics & Monitoring** - Observability
- [x] **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and input sanitization
